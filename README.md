# Face-Detection-and-Recognition-System-using-MATLAB
Developed a face detection and recognition system using MATLAB, incorporating Viola-Jones algorithm for real-time face detection and Eigenfaces (PCA-based) technique for face recognition.
Enabled accurate face identification across static images, video streams, and real-time webcam input using MATLAB’s Computer Vision Toolbox and custom UI.
Achieved robust performance in varied lighting and expressions, demonstrating the application’s potential in authentication, surveillance, and HCI scenarios.
